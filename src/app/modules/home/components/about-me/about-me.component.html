                I am a web developer who enjoys designing and developing front end web applications; particulary with Angular or React.<br><br>
                In my junior year of college, I first discovered my passion for writing code while making a front end web application
                for a transportation startup using JavaScript, and the Google Maps SDK.<br><br>
                I have been developing on the front end since; taking in as much knowledge and experience that I can--learning new languages,
                development patterns, and tooling to create an awesome user experience.

                In my spare time, I enjoy hiking, backpacking, and snowbording! I have begun to take great interest in mountaineering, and have been learning about the different knowledge areas needed to climb mountains with proficiency.

                My recent focus has been in front end web development with React and Angular, and cloud computing with CI/CD pipelines with Azure DevOps. In addition, I have recently taken great interest in machine learning, and am currently exploring a way to apply this technology to a current project.
